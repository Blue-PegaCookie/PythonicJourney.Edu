# Welcome To Python

# This is going to be an introductory for the programming language Python

# It'll compromise everything you would need to know about Python and how to tackle it

# Let's start! Hope you have fun :)

# Before we start if you're completely new to this then i would recommend using Pycharm as your IDE
# IDE = Integrated Development Environment (A software used to create other software!)

# You should also download the python software to make this work!

# Now let's actually start!

# By the way if you would like the videos I learnt this from i have attached it on my github
# (I guess you're looking at this from there!)

print("Hello!My friend")

print("This is going to be a wonderful journey Let's Start Learning! :0 ")

# Lesson 1

# What's a Datatype? Mate Explain...

# Datatypes

datatype = "There are many datatypes which store data. The below are examples"

# Datatype: String
string = "This is a string (A series of characters) enclosed in ("") or ('')."

# Variable Store Datatypes
variable = "It is a container for a value. It behaves as the value it contains. It's not constant"

print(datatype)

# Name example

name = "Blue_PegaCookie"

# This prints the variable
print(name)

# This prints a string of text before the variable and we can add it
print("Hello, "+name)

# This prints the data type of the varible
print(type(name))

# Full name example

# Use a underscore to combine to words to make sense and make it a variable.
first_name = "Blue"

middle_name = "Pega"

last_name = "Cookie"

full_name = (first_name+"_"+middle_name+last_name)

print("Hello, "+full_name)

# Datatype: Integer
Integer = "A whole number i.e 1, 6, 9...."

#Age Example

age = 15

print(age)

print(type(age))

new_age = age + 1
# You could also do new_age += 1 (It's the same thing but better :)!

print(new_age)

# We usually use the datatype int to operate math operations in python not strings.
